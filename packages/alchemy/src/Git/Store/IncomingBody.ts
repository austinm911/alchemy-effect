 * the full alchemy-history push with a 500). The body is fed chunk by
 * chunk into a {@link StreamingFeeder} the parser reads from as bytes
 * arrive; the parser ends the body's life in memory by dispatching it in
 * uniform parts to the hasher isolates, which write the parts to blob
 * storage (the spill) while verifying them.
 *
 * The command section of a receive-pack request lives in the first bytes,
 * so the first {@link HEAD_BYTES} are enough to parse the ref commands
 * before the pack has arrived.
